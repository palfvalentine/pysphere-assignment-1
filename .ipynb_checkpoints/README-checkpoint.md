 ## Ohm's Law Calculator

This Python script calculates voltage (V) based on user-provided values for current (I) and resistance (R) using Ohm's Law: V = I * R.

## Usage
**Run the script: python ohms_law.py**

Enter the current in **amperes (A)** when prompted.
Enter the resistance in **ohms** when prompted.

The script will output the calculated voltage in volts.

## Example
Enter the current (in A): 4
Enter the resistance (in ohms): 15
The voltage is: 60 volts

## Requirements
Python 3.x
